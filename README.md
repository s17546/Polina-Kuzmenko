Book design with AR for children
Description: 
My project is a book design of Ukrainian Folk tale with augmented reality animations for kids.
And my theoretical part I about the role of folk tale nowadays.
Work in progress:
Right now, I'm working on the bookcover and typoghrahy design of the book. Also, I started creating animations for AR, 
I am waiting for replies from professors Jan Piechota and Marcin Wichrowski to continue the work.

New update: I have chosen concept for a book cover, and I'm in process of improving it. I have translated the book into English and now I'm waiting for approval from a native speaker professor Joshua Gerard Plough. After I receive his confirmation I want to ask for a consultation from professor Jan Piechota on typography design of the book. As to AR animations - I have made all of which I will use, and I have started implementing them in Artivive. But I have faced some problems, which I am trying to fix right now under the supervision of professor Marcin Wichrowski.
